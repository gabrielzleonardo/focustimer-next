#  FocusTimer em Next

This project was a challenge proposed in the Explorer course by [RocketSeat](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/), but I decided to do it in NextJS to learn more about this framework. The application consists of a timer to apply the [Pomodoro technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique). Additionally, it has a dark theme, some sounds to aid concentration, and a volume selector for them.
